# Infinite Photos

This is a very simple, responsive [Ghost](http://ghost.org) theme that specifically shows only photos and titles, and loads each photo post in sequence as you scroll down the page.  It was built for use as a photography portfolio.

## Setup

Just like all Ghost themes, all you need to do is copy the theme folder to your `ghost/content/themes` folder, restart Ghost and then select it from the Settings page.

## Creating Photo Posts

1. Upload an image into your post and give it a title of ```main-image```. 

2. Add a ```photos``` tag to your post.
